          <p class="course-description">A one-day interior redesign seminar</p>

            but want to know more, or if you are simply interested in redesign for your own home, we&rsquo;ve designed a one-day seminar just for you.</p>
          <p><img src="images/redesign_dining_living.jpg" alt="The School of Interior Redesign's one day Introduction to Interior Redesign seminar is for anyone interested in exploring redesign as a possible career or learning about redesign for your own home." width="179" height="250" hspace="8" vspace="0" align="right" />The day begins with a get-acquainted session as we get to know each other a little better. We then spend the morning discussing the basics of interior redesign. Included in the discussion are:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>How to begin an interior redesign </li>
            <li>Tools and supplies </li>
            <li>Analyzing the room </li>
            <li>Determining form and function </li>
            <li>&ldquo;Shopping&rdquo; the home </li>
            <li>Proper furniture placement, hanging of artwork, and accessorizing </li>
            <li>Finishing touches </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Then, after lunch, we take a field trip to someone&rsquo;s home and actually redesign a room!</p>
          <p>At the end of the day you will be prepared to take everything you learned and transform your own home&mdash;starting tomorrow!</p>
