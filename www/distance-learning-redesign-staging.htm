            and distance can sometimes make  face-to-face training
            difficult.&nbsp; To help you pursue your goal of a business
            in <strong>interior decorating, interior redesign, or
            real estate staging</strong>,
            the School of Interior Redesign offers distance learning programs to complete in the comfort of your own home.</p>
          <p align="left">Each of the School of Interior Redesign's At-Home Study Programs&mdash;whether creative or business related&mdash;have been developed
            to prepare you for a career in one of several design-related fields.</p>
          <blockquote>
            <p align="left">Based
              on <strong>tried and true design principles and business methodology</strong>, the
              programs cover several specialized fields of design and include
              interior redesign, real estate staging, and color, in addition
              to conventional interior decorating services. These courses cover the same material as the in-person workshops, but in a format to ensure each skill is learned before moving on to the next one.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <h2 align="left">Designed to Fit Your Needs</h2>
          <p align="left">Both creative and business <strong>courses can be taken
              individually, or mixed and matched</strong> with other creative
              and/or business programs, depending on your needs.&nbsp; Whether
              you are already a professional designer who needs help marketing
              your business, an interior decorator who wishes to add real estate
              staging to your list of services, or a novice home decorator who
              has always dreamed of becoming a design professional, we have the
              program for you.</p>
          <p align="left">All of our distance learning programs offer <strong>one-on-one
              instruction</strong> as well as a variety of hands-on projects
              and exercises designed to test your knowledge and skills.&nbsp; Each
              exercise is reviewed and critiqued by a personal tutor who will provide you with both <strong>written
              and verbal feedback</strong> in every area of instruction.</p>
          <p align="left">Best of all, instead of commuting to classes, you can <strong>learn
              from the comfort of your own home and on your own schedule</strong>.&nbsp; And
              you can be assured that regardless of which course you choose,
              you'll receive the same quality of education that you would receive
              in a traditional classroom setting.</p>

          <h2 align="left"><a name="Certified_Interior_Decorator_Professional_Training" id="Certified_Interior_Decorator_Professional_Training"></a>Certified Decorating Professional&reg;  </h2>
          <p align="left">You can offer affordable solutions to your clients
            without the designer price-tag. Our program will teach you
            how to improve the functionality and aesthetic of a home using tried
            and true design principles and placement techniques that will result
            in beautiful rooms. You'll learn how to <strong>offer decorating and
            color consultations</strong>, how to <strong>accessorize</strong> a room like a pro, and how
            to <strong>price your services</strong> for every budget. And that's just for
            starters! (<a href="assets/sir-certified-decorating-professional-home-study.pdf" target="_blank">Learn

          <p align="left">The Interior Redesign program focuses on teaching you
            how to <strong>use your client's own furnishings</strong> and accessories to create
            warm and inviting spaces for a fraction of the cost of conventional
            decorating. <strong>This practical approach to decorating</strong> is becoming
            more and more popular as people realize the incredible difference
            interior redesign (also known as one-day decorating) can make in
            their homes. This <strong>'green' design method</strong> focuses on placement
            techniques that create a functional and beautiful room without having
            to purchase additional items. You'll learn how to re-purpose,
            re-use, re-fresh, and re-design with style. (<a href="assets/sir-interior-redesign-home-study.pdf" target="_blank">Learn

          <p>The Real Estate Staging program takes you through the entire process
            of preparing homes for sale, <strong>from the staging consultation, all the
            way to working with sellers as they make major (or minor) changes</strong> to their property to increase its value and decrease the amount of
            time it takes to sell.&nbsp; You will learn what to do, how to do
            it, as well as when to stop.&nbsp; (<a href="assets/sir-real-estate-staging.pdf" target="_blank">Learn
            more</a>.) </p>
          <h2>Interior Redesign and Real Estate Staging </h2>
          <p>The best of both worlds. <strong>Redesign and staging go hand in hand.</strong> Once you have learned the placement techniques in the redesign program, you can apply those same techniques when staging homes. The workshop explains the <strong>similarities and differences between redesign and staging and how to incorporate them in each situation</strong>.
