            <h1 align="center"> What You Should Know About<br /> 
            Training and Certification</h1>
            <p align="left">Because there are so many programs, teaching methods,
              and certifications available, with more appearing every day, making
              decisions about the program you take can become confusing. Here
              are some things you should find out about any training program
              you are considering:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>                <strong>What is the business experience
                  in the field of instruction of the person conducting the training?&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
                  <br />
              </strong>Many
                  people barely start a business, then decide to teach others
                  how to run a similar business.&nbsp; If you don't have experience
                  running your own business, how can you teach others to do the
              same?&nbsp; The combined experience for the instructors for <strong>School
              of Interior Redesign</strong> is over 30 years! </li>
            </ul>
         
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Has the program received state approval? </strong>&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                Many
                states require training programs to be state approved, yet many
                (if not most) of the people doing the training either don't know
                that or don't bother to get that approval.&nbsp; States require
                approval for the protection of the students.&nbsp; Make sure
                the program you take has that approval.&nbsp; The <strong>School
                of Interior Redesign</strong> is approved by the Connecticut Department of Higher
                Education as a private occupational school, which means its programs
                and instructors have been carefully reviewed and approved, ensuring
                you receive the best possible education available. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>How large is the class?  </strong>&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                The smaller
                the class size, the more attention you will receive from the
                instructor, assuring your training needs are met.&nbsp; The class
                size for each of the in-person programs offered by the <strong>School
                of Interior Redesign</strong> does not exceed five students.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What types of training aids are used during
                the training?</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                We
                don't all learn the same way.&nbsp; A training program should
                incorporate a variety of teaching methods and aids, including
                lecture, exercises, visual aids, and, of course, hands-on.&nbsp; Regardless
                of the program you take, the <strong>School of Interior Redesign</strong> curriculum
                ensures you have the hands-on training you need to succeed. </li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>What happens after class?</strong>&nbsp; <br />
                <br />
                This can be
                one of the most confusing aspects of training.&nbsp; Many training
                programs offer certification after completion, believing that
                will make their program more attractive.&nbsp; However, there
                is no recognized certification at either the state or national
                level for any programs in redesign, staging, or interior decorating.&nbsp; Certification
                is simply self-certification by the person doing the training,
                or certification by an organization the individual joins after
                the training.&nbsp; It does nothing to improve the quality of
                the training, nor is it anything clients understand or even ask
                about.&nbsp; Instead of certification, know what type of on-going
                support is available to you after the program ends, and at what
                cost.&nbsp; At the <strong>School of Interior Redesign</strong>, we are always
                available to help, regardless of when you completed your program
                with us.&nbsp; And you are welcome to return for a &quot;refresher&quot;
                (space permitting) after you have completed your course.&nbsp; And
                to ensure you receive support from others outside of SIR, you
                are eligible to join the Association of Design Education (<a href="http://www.associationofdesigneducation.com" target="_blank">www.associationofdesigneducation.com</a>),
                an organization founded to both ensure the quality of your training
                experience, as well as to provide ongoing education and support
                as you grow your business. </li>
