<h1>Introduction to Interior Decorating</h1>
<p class="course-description">A one-day interior decorating seminar</p>

<p><img src="images/bigstockphoto_Luxurious_Red_Chair_With_Satin_1436879.jpg" width="200" height="324" alt="" align="right"/><strong>Have you wondered what the tips and tricks are that pros use when designing rooms? Do you have a room or rooms in your own home you’d like to really pull together? Or do you just want a better understanding of how to make it all&mdash;colors, fabrics, styles&mdash;work together.</strong> We’ve created a fun one-day seminar to teach you how to do just that!</p> 
<p>The day begins with a get-acquainted session as we get to know each other a little better and discuss our own decorating dilemmas. Then we begin to learn how to take a room from less-than-fetching to fabulous! Included in the discussion are:</p>
<ul>
	<li>Basic principles of design</li>
	<li>Where to start when decorating a room</li>
	<li>The step-by-step process to a successful design</li>
	<li>Understanding colors (and we’re not just talking paint)</li>
	<li>Incorporating patterns and textures</li>
	<li>How to make it all work together</li>
</ul>
<p>And we don’t just talk! We have fun creating a vision for our room – and making that vision actually work. Through hands-on exercises, we will pull together rooms of our own creation, with ideas we can take back into our homes to pull together ourselves. We’ll work with colors, fabrics, styles and incorporate the design principles to make a room that sings! Never again will you wonder "does this really go together?" You’ll know!</p>
<p>At the end of the day you will be prepared to take everything you learned and transform your own home&mdash;starting tomorrow!</p>
