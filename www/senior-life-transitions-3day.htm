                and more important as Baby Boomers move into their retirement
                years and beyond</strong>.&nbsp; Our
                Certificate Program has been <em>approved by the Commissioner
                of Higher Education for the State of Connecticut</em>, which

              <li>Necessary safety precautions to consider when working with
                seniors, including space/floor planning, lighting, moving considerations
                - and so much more!</li>
