Here              are some things you should find out about any training program              you are considering:   What is the business experience                  in the field of instruction of the person conducting the training?   Many                  people barely start a business, then decide to teach others                  how to run a similar business.  If you don't have experience                  running your own business, how can you teach others to do the              same?  The combined experience for the instructors for School              of Interior Redesign is over 30 years! Has the program received state approval?   Many                states require training programs to be state approved, yet many                (if not most) of the people doing the training either don't know                that or don't bother to get that approval.  States require                approval for the protection of the students.  Make sure                the program you take has that approval.  The School                of Interior Redesign is approved by the Connecticut Department of Higher                Education as a private occupational school, which means its programs                and instructors have been carefully reviewed and approved, ensuring                you receive the best possible education available. How large is the class?   The smaller                the class size, the more attention you will receive from the                instructor, assuring your training needs are met.  The class                size for each of the in-person programs offered by the School                of Interior Redesign does not exceed five students. What types of training aids are used during                the training?    We                don't all learn the same way.  A training program should                incorporate a variety of teaching methods and aids, including                lecture, exercises, visual aids, and, of course, hands-on.  Regardless                of the program you take, the School of Interior Redesign curriculum                ensures you have the hands-on training you need to succeed. What happens after class?   This can be                one of the most confusing aspects of training.  Many training                programs offer certification after completion, believing that                will make their program more attractive.  However, there                is no recognized certification at either the state or national                level for any programs in redesign, staging, or interior decorating.  Certification                is simply self-certification by the person doing the training,                or certification by an organization the individual joins after                the training.  It does nothing to improve the quality of                the training, nor is it anything clients understand or even ask                about.  Instead of certification, know what type of on-going                support is available to you after the program ends, and at what                cost.  At the School of Interior Redesign , we are always                available to help, regardless of when you completed your program                with us.  And you are welcome to return for a &quot;refresher&quot;                (space permitting) after you have completed your course.  And                to ensure you receive support from others outside of SIR, you                are eligible to join the Association of Design Education ( www.associationofdesigneducation.com ),                an organization founded to both ensure the quality of your training                experience, as well as to provide ongoing education and support                as you grow your business.                   Home              Page | Questions              to Ask About Interior Design, Redesign, or Home Staging Training              and Certification | Interior            Redesign Classes | Introduction            to Interior Redesign Interior            Redesign for the Professional | Interior            Redesign/Staging Intensive Class | Real            Estate Staging Classes | Real            Estate Staging Intensive 1-Day            Real Estate Staging Home Staging for the Professional | 2-Day            Real Estate Staging Home Staging for the Professional | Certified            Interior Decorator Training Classes | 3-Day            Become an Interior Decorator Training and Certificate Program Senior            Life Transition Professional Workshop for Interior Redesigners, Interior            Decorators, Home Stagers and Real Estate Stagers Working with Seniors            55+ Feng Shui Classes for Interior Redesigners, Interior Decorators,            Home Stagers and Real Estate Stagers or to Start a Feng Shui Related            Business Feng            Shui Interior Decorating or Interior Redecorating Room by Room | Feng            Shui Home Staging and Real Estate Staging | Feng            Shui for Any Business Green            Design | Green Design with RedesignTraining Workshop to Incorporate            Green Design into Your Interior Redesign or Home Staging Business Calendar:            Interior Redesign Classes, Interior Decorating Courses, Real Estate            Staging and Home Staging Classes | Register            Online Secure Online Payment | Meet            the School of Interior Redesign Staff | Free            Interior Redesign, Interior Decorating, Home Staging, Real Estate            Staging E-Zine Find            an Interior Redesigner or Real Estate Staging Specialist | Real            Estate Staging and Interior Redesign Resources | Contact            the School of Interior Redesign LLC Site                Map of the School's Interior Redesign Training and Real Estate              Staging Training Classes, Workshops, Seminars | Search              Our Website         Return              to top of page Copyright © 2004-2011 School of Interior Redesign, LLC.  All  rights reserved.

Get a closer look at flooring, paint, wallcovering,                  window treatments, and lighting that will truly make a difference              in our lives! Reuse, Resell, Recondition, and Reclaim Learn how to incorporate environmentally friendly products into                  your clients' design plans, while keeping in mind the principles                  of redesign.  When new products are necessary, learn the green                  sources you have available, as well as the impact the purchasing                  power you have as a design expert has on the environment.

You need access to the internet and a land-based (preferably)              telephone line. There is an instructor conducting each class session.  The              students interact with the instructor just as if they are in a              real classroom. You receive a manual prior to the start of class.  You are              given sections of the manual to read prior to each session.  There              may be other homework assignments given as well.  You also              need a digital camera as you will be asked to take before and after              photos of your projects to download to the computer. After completion of the class and the final exam, you will receive              your Certificate! That's it!  It's almost like being in class.   Home Study:  in your own time at your own pace   If scheduling is a bit of a problem for you, a home study course            may work better.  These are courses done during your own time            and at your own pace.  Here's how a home study course works: Once you sign up for the course, you will receive the first module.  The              number of modules to be completed depends on the course.  See              below for more information. Once you have completed the module and the corresponding assignments,              the assignments are sent to the instructor for review.  It              may be helpful to have a digital camera to download before and              after pictures of your projects so you can send them via email. The instructor reviews the assignment, provides feedback, and              sends the next module. The instructor is available through telephone or email to answer              questions, address issues, and provide whatever assistance is needed              for you to complete the module. After all modules and the final exam are completed, you will              receive your Certificate!

Based              on tried and true design principles and business methodology , the              programs cover several specialized fields of design and include              interior redesign, real estate staging, and color, in addition              to conventional interior decorating services.  All              formulated with the adult learner in mind. Designed to Fit Your Needs   Both creative and business courses can be taken              individually, or mixed and matched with other creative              and/or business programs, depending on your needs.  Whether              you are already a professional designer who needs help marketing              your business, an interior decorator who wishes to add real estate              staging to your list of services, or a novice home decorator who              has always dreamed of becoming a design professional, we have the              program for you.   All of our distance learning programs offer one-on-one              instruction as well as a variety of hands-on projects              and exercises designed to test your knowledge and skills.  Each              exercise is reviewed and critiqued by a personal tutor and a team              of professional design instructors who provide you with both written              and verbal feedback in every area of instruction.   Best of all, instead of commuting to classes, you can learn              from the comfort of your own home and on your own schedule .  And              you can be assured that regardless of which course you choose,              you'll receive the same quality of education that you would receive              in a traditional classroom setting. The Courses Certified Decorating Professional®   You can offer affordable solutions to your clients            without the designer price-tag.  Our program will teach you            how to improve the functionality and aesthetic of a home using tried            and true design principles and placement techniques that will result            in beautiful rooms.  You'll learn how to offer decorating and            color consultations, how to accessorize a room like a pro, and how            to price your services for every budget.  And that's just for            starters!  ( Learn            more .)   Interior Redesign   The Interior Redesign program focuses on teaching you            how to use your client's own furnishings and accessories to create            warm and inviting spaces for a fraction of the cost of conventional            decorating.  This practical approach to decorating is becoming            more and more popular as people realize the incredible difference            interior redesign (also known as one-day decorating) can make in            their homes.  This 'green' design method focuses on placement            techniques that create a functional and beautiful room without having            to purchase additional items.  You'll learn how to re-purpose,            re-use, re-fresh, and re-design with style.  ( Learn            more .)   Real Estate Staging   The Real Estate Staging program takes you through the entire process            of preparing homes for sale, from the staging consultation, all the            way to working with sellers as they make major (or minor) changes            to their property to increase its value and decrease the amount of            time it takes to sell.  You will learn what to do, how to do            it, as well as when to stop.  ( Learn            more .)   Interior Redesign and Real Estate Staging   The best of both worlds.  Redesign and staging go hand in hand.  Once            you have learned the placement techniques in the redesign program,            you can apply those same techniques when staging homes.   Starting Your Design-Related Business   Are you in business for yourself?  Some people            find that they may have missed a few steps along the way.  Our            SYB manual touches on every aspect and detail of starting a business,            to get you up and running (legally).  Our goal is to teach you            how to own and operate a design-related business for very little            money.  We want you to think big, but start small.  ( Learn            more .)   Marketing Your Design-Related Business   This manual is jam-packed with creative ways to market            your business effectively.  Written from a designer's perspective,            we know that the way you do business today has changed, so we've            provided a myriad of ideas, and instruction on how you can implement            these ideas for very little money.  ( Learn            more .)
