            <p class="testimonial">&quot;I wanted to send a note of thanks for
              the workshop you provided through The School of Interior Redesign.&nbsp; This
              Senior Life Transition Professional Workshop was chock full of
              valuable and practical information...[and] gave an overview of
              the 'start to finish' process of helping a senior client downsize,
              age in place or move to a new location.&nbsp; This workshop has
              given me the knowledge and confidence to be able to provide my
              senior clients and their families the compassionate and thorough
              service that they want, need and deserve.</p>
            <p class="testimonial">I would recommend this workshop to anyone

              to expand their home staging or redesign business and is ready
              to tap into the growing 55+ market.&quot;</p>
